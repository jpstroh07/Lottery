# Lottery

This was my first project, which was created back in 2017. </br>
This project is a java application. It is a basic lotto application, which asks for 7 numbers between 1 and 49 and a super-number between 1 and 9. The language is german. </br>
It is not perfect and can be reworked much smarter, but it was my first project, so I will not change the base.
