# Lottery

This was my first project, which was created back in 2017.

This project is a java application. It is a basic lotto application, which asks for 7 numbers between 1 and 49 and a super-number between 1 and 9.

The project was reworked in 2019. The old code can be found in the [Old Code](OldCode) directory. The new, rewritten code can be found in the [New Code](NewCode) directory. The language of the old program is in german, while the new program is in english.
